# clj-datastore

_Clojure support for Google Datastore_

## tl;dr

clj-datastore is a library written on top of [java-datastore](https://github.com/googleapis/java-datastore)
to be used with clojure datatypes.

## Project status

clj-datastore is alpha software at the moment, this doesn't mean that the project cannot be used or it has
poor quality, it does mean that probably will exist changes over the source code that could break the API.
